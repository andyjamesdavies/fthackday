            "body": "<p><span class=\"ft-bold\">Wednesday 12:00 BST</span>. Festering eurozone concerns and worries about global growth are once again damping investor sentiment as the rally at the start of the week proves all too brief.</p>\n<p>The FTSE All-World equity index is down 1.1 per cent, hurt by a 1.6 per cent slide in the Asia-Pacific region and a slump in Europe. Industrial commodities are in retreat while money is moving into “core” fixed income products such as the US Treasury and German Bund. </p>\n<p>The dollar index – considered a barometer of trader wariness – is up 0.1 per cent and sitting near 20-month highs as the euro slides. Gold is down 0.6 per cent to $1,559 an ounce and the Athens stock market has hit a fresh 22-year trough.</p>\n<p>S&amp;P 500 futures point to Wall Street losing 0.6 per cent later in the day. Technology stocks may be under pressure after shares in computer maker Dell fell 8 per cent in extended trading after news that the company’s <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/b8df99b6-a453-11e1-a701-00144feabdc0.html\">quarterly earnings had missed estimates</a>.</p>\n<p>So-called risk assets had mostly spent the previous two sessions bouncing off multi-month lows on hopes that today’s EU summit would deliver a plan for promoting both growth and fiscal discipline within the region, while averting a Greek exit from the euro.</p>\n<p>Comments out of China that suggested <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/74cf3198-a339-11e1-ab98-00144feabdc0.html\">Beijing was prepared to take more fiscal and monetary steps</a> to boost the world’s second-biggest economy also lent support to the bulls.</p>\n<p>But that optimistic renaissance has proved shortlived as traders recognise that any effective eurozone consensus will be difficult to achieve and after trade data from Japan show softer export growth than forecast, raising fears about the strength of global demand.</p>\n<p>“We doubt that Wednesday evening’s EU summit will result in many groundbreaking concrete agreements,” analysts at Barclays said in a research note. “It seems unlikely that market confidence will return until there is more visibility about developments in Greece, and Europe more generally.” </p>\n<p>The FTSE Eurofirst 300 is losing 1.6 per cent as miners and banks again take a pasting. The euro is down 0.2 per cent to $1.2662, having touched $1.2616, its weakest since August 2010, as uncertainty about the outcome of the <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/97ffeba0-a107-11e1-aac1-00144feabdc0.html\">Greek election</a> in June and the health of the <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/776a8116-a34b-11e1-8f34-00144feabdc0.html\">Spanish banking system</a> nag at investors.</p>\n<p>Spanish 10-year bond yields speak of renewed tension in the eurozone “peripheral” bond complex, rising 4 basis points to 6.11 per cent.</p>\n<p>The other side of that coin is the desire for perceived havens. This was starkly illustrated on Wednesday when <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/89b5b45c-a4be-11e1-9a94-00144feabdc0.html\">Berlin auctioned €4.5bn of two-year paper </a>at a coupon of nought per cent. Ten-year notes in the secondary market are seeing more demand and the yield is down 6bp to 1.42 per cent, just several basis points above record lows.</p>\n<p>The yield on US 10-year Treasuries is down 4bp to 1.74 per cent. The US Treasury managed to sell $35bn in two-year notes amid solid demand on Tuesday and it will also auction $64bn in five- and seven-year notes this week.</p>\n<p>Japan’s 10-year note yield also remains near recent lows, proving stoic in the face of <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/631baac6-a401-11e1-84b1-00144feabdc0.html\">Fitch’s downgrade of the country’s credit rating</a>.</p>\n<p>Tokyo’s stock market has not been so robust. The downgrade, a <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/16960f8e-a48d-11e1-84b1-00144feabdc0.html\">lack of action by the Bank of Japan</a> after its latest policy meeting, and general global risk aversion has helped send the Nikkei 225 down 2 per cent, with financial shares hard hit.</p>\n<p>Further pressure was added by news of a wider than expected trade deficit of Y520.3bn in April because of a drop in shipments to China.</p>\n<p>The Shanghai Composite lost 0.4 per cent, with investors wary about committing fresh funds before Thursday’s “flash” purchasing managers manufacturing survey, often a market mover.</p>\n<p>China fretting tends to put pressure on commodities, and copper is down 1.7 per cent to $3.43 a pound and Brent crude is off 1.2 per cent at $107.09 a barrel.</p>\n<p><span class=\"ft-italic\"><span class=\"ft-bold\">Note</span>. In the Trading Post column in Wednesday’s FT, I inexplicably wrote that the Federal Reserve’s Operation Twist was due to end in August, even though I knew it is due to end in June. Apologies.</span>\n</p>\n<p/>"
